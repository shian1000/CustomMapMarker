description: 'Make sure the release APK of this repo is up to date (rebuilding it if not), then copy it to custom_map_marker.apk and serve it over the Tailscale network for 15 minutes under a fixed download link that always points at the newest build, after which the server stops by itself. Trigger on "/share-build-tailscale", "udostępnij builda", "daj link do apki", "share the build", "send me the APK link", or when the user wants to download/install the current build on a device without a USB cable. Do not trigger when the user wants it installed on the USB-connected phone right now — that is run-on-physical-phone.'

# Share build over Tailscale

## What this does, in order

1. Check whether the release APK reflects the current code.
2. If not, rebuild it (with the same memory precautions as run-on-physical-phone).
3. Serve only that APK over Tailscale for 15 minutes; the server then stops on its own.
4. Give the user the direct download link and the time it expires.

Run everything from the repo root.

## Step 1 — Is the build current?

```bash
.claude/skills/share-build-tailscale/scripts/check_build_fresh.sh
```

It compares `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk` with everything that goes into it
(`lib/`, `pubspec.yaml`, `pubspec.lock`, `android/` minus build outputs, `assets/` if present).

- `fresh` → skip to Step 3.
- `missing` or `stale: <file>` → Step 2. Mention which file made it stale.

The script only compares file times. If the user says code changed in a way it can't see
(e.g. a dependency in the pub cache was edited), rebuild anyway.

## Step 2 — Rebuild

Follow **Step 2b (memory check)** and **Step 3 (build)** of
`.claude/skills/run-on-physical-phone/SKILL.md`, but skip the install. That means: stop leftover
Gradle daemons, check `free -m` (ask the user before building below 2500 MB available), run
`flutter build apk --release`, then stop the Gradle daemon with the Studio JBR as `JAVA_HOME`.
Don't copy those commands here from memory; read that file so both skills stay in sync.

Re-run `check_build_fresh.sh` afterwards; it must print `fresh`.

## Step 3 — Serve it

```bash
.claude/skills/share-build-tailscale/scripts/serve_apk.sh 15
```

The script:

- binds to this machine's **Tailscale** IPv4 (`tailscale ip -4`, currently `100.116.249.111`), so
  only devices on the user's tailnet can reach it. Never bind to `0.0.0.0` or the LAN address.
  If Tailscale is down, the script exits with code 2; tell the user, don't fall back to another
  interface.
- copies the APK to `build/share/custom_map_marker.apk` and serves only that directory. The file
  name, port and Tailscale IP don't change, so the link is always the same:
  `http://100.116.249.111:8000/custom_map_marker.apk`, and it always points at the build just
  checked. Every response carries `Cache-Control: no-store` (`scripts/no_cache_server.py`), so the
  phone's browser can't hand out a previously downloaded, older APK under the same URL.
- runs the server under `timeout` in its own session (`setsid nohup … & disown`, the same pattern
  that keeps scrcpy alive), so it stops by itself after 15 minutes even if this conversation ends.
- replaces an earlier share started by this script (PID in `build/share-server.pid`). If port
  8000 is taken by some other program, it exits with code 4 instead of switching ports (that
  would change the link): show the user what holds the port (`ss -ltnp 'sport = :8000'`) and ask.
- checks the link with `curl` before printing `URL=…`, `BUILT=…` (APK build time) and
  `EXPIRES=HH:MM`.

Run it as one foreground Bash call; it returns within a few seconds. Never stop the server with
`pkill -f <pattern>`: the pattern also matches the Bash tool's own shell and kills the call.
To stop it early, use `kill -- -$(cat build/share-server.pid)`.

## Step 4 — Report back

Answer in Polish with:

- the link (from `URL=`), as a plain clickable URL, noting it's the same permanent link as always,
- which build it serves (from `BUILT=`),
- when it expires (from `EXPIRES=`),
- whether the APK was rebuilt or already current,
- a reminder that the phone must be connected to Tailscale and allow installing apps from the
  browser ("nieznane źródła"). The APK is signed with the debug key, so it updates an
  existing install of this app without losing maps.
